## Info(通知) 
This is the last Beta version, thank you for your support along the way, despite the very small number, but how can I say, it's still very much appreciated!
Along the way, the coders have grown from one person (12sdj) at the beginning to two. There was also a volunteer from an unfamiliar country who helped us write a Readme file in his country's language, and although he hasn't updated it in a while, I will continue to update the Readme.al file and improve the version in his country's language. In addition to the help of my close friends during the writing process, there was another stranger who followed my code - this gave me motivation ......
Let's stop here ......
The official version has arrived!

这是最后一个Beta版本，感谢您的一路支持，尽管人数极少，但怎么说，还是非常感谢！
一路走来，代码编写人员从最开始的一人(12sdj)发展成了二人。还有一名来自陌生国家的志愿者帮助我们写好了一个国家语言的Readme文件，尽管他有一段时间没有更新了，但我会继续更新Readme.al文件，完善他国家语言的版本。在编写过程中，除了我身边朋友的帮助，还有另一位陌生人，他关注了我的代码-这给了我动力……
先说到这吧……
正式版本已经到来！
